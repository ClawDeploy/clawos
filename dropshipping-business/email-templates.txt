<h1>Hey {{first_name|default:"there"}}! 👋</h1>

<p>Yesterday you joined our community - today I want to show you exactly how easy magnetic lashes are to apply.</p>

<p>Most people think it's complicated... until they try it.</p>

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;">

  </a>
  <p><em>Click to watch the 60-second tutorial</em></p>
</div>

<h2>The 3-Step Process:</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Apply the Magnetic Liner</h3>
<p>Shake well and draw a line along your upper lash line, just like regular eyeliner.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Wait 30 Seconds</h3>
<p>Let the liner get tacky (this is the secret!).</p>

<h3>Step 3: Snap On the Lashes</h3>
<p>Place the magnetic lashes onto the liner - they'll literally SNAP into place!</p>

<div style="background: #f3e5f5; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; border-left: 4px solid #9c27b0;">
  <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Start with the outer corner and work your way in for easiest placement!</p>

### Email 4: FAQ / Objection Handling

**Subject Lines:**
- Your magnetic lash questions, answered
- "Will they stay on?" + other FAQs
- Everything you wanted to know 💭

**Email Body:**
```html
<h1>Questions? We got answers! 💡</h1>

<p>Hey {{first_name|default:"there"}},</p>

<p>We've helped over 50,000 women switch to magnetic lashes, so we've heard pretty much every question!</p>

<p>Here are the most common ones:</p>

<h3>❓ "Will they actually stay on all day?"</h3>
<p><strong>YES!</strong> Our 5-magnet technology creates a hold so secure, you can wear them through work, workouts, and even swimming. The waterproof formula means they won't budge.</p>

<h3>❓ "Are they hard to apply?"</h3>
<p><strong>Not at all!</strong> Most customers are shocked at how easy it is. Apply liner → wait 30 seconds → place lashes. Done! It takes most people 10 seconds after their first try.</p>

<h3>❓ "Will they damage my natural lashes?"</h3>
<p><strong>Actually, they're gentler!</strong> Unlike glue lashes that pull on your natural lashes during removal, magnetic lashes simply lift off. Many customers say their natural lashes have actually grown stronger since switching.</p>

<h3>❓ "What if I don't like them?"</h3>
<p><strong>Full refund!</strong> We have a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you don't absolutely love them, return for a full refund. No questions asked.</p>

<div style="background: #fce4ec; padding: 20px; text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;">

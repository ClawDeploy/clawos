Subject: Dropshipping Partnership - Magnetic Lashes

Dear [Supplier Name],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is [Your Name] and I am 
the founder of Magnetic Lash Pro, a new beauty brand specializing in 
magnetic eyelashes.

I recently ordered samples from your store and was very impressed with 
the quality of your [product name]. I would like to discuss establishing 
a dropshipping partnership.

About My Business:
- Newly launched e-commerce store
- Target market: US/Canada beauty consumers
- Projected volume: 100-200 orders/month initially
- Scaling to 500+ orders/month within 6 months
- Shopify platform with automated fulfillment

I am interested in:
1. Dropshipping arrangement with no MOQ
2. Processing time of 1-3 business days
3. White-label packaging (no supplier branding)
4. Bulk pricing for volume growth
5. Quality consistency guarantees

My target retail price is $24.99-29.99, so I need a landed cost under 
$8 to maintain healthy margins.

Could you please provide:
- Your best dropshipping pricing
- Processing and shipping timeframes
- Packaging options (branded/unbranded)
- Return/refund policy
- Any volume discount tiers

I am ready to start with 50 units/month and scale from there.

Thank you for your time. I look forward to building a successful 
partnership together.

Best regards,
